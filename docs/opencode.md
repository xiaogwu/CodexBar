# OpenCode provider

## Data sources
- Browser cookies from `opencode.ai`. Two session cookies matter: `auth` (legacy pages and server
  functions) and `__Host-console_session` (the console). Both are forwarded, and either one alone is
  enough for an import to succeed, because a migrated workspace may carry only the console cookie.
- OpenCode Go usage API at `GET https://opencode.ai/zen/go/v1/usage`, authenticated by `OPENCODE_API_KEY` or
  `providers[].apiKey`, or a selected token account's API key.
- OpenCode Go local history from `~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db` on macOS and Linux.
- OpenCode Console JSON, used first for OpenCode Go web reads:
  - `GET https://opencode.ai/console/api/orgs` lists workspaces (cookie auth only).
  - `GET https://opencode.ai/console/api/go/status` returns subscription meters and requires the workspace in the
    `x-org-id` header; the console answers HTTP 400 without it.
  - `GET https://opencode.ai/console/api/billing/status` reads the selected workspace's prepaid PAYG Zen balance
    with the same `x-org-id` header. Convert its signed `balanceMicroCents` string to USD by dividing by 100,000,000;
    `availableMicroCents` is a separate credit value and is not substituted for the balance.
- `POST https://opencode.ai/_server` with server function IDs, used for workspaces that have not migrated to the
  console and for the Zen balance:
  - `workspaces` (`def39973159c7f0483d8793a822b8dbb10d067e12c65455fcb4608459ba0234f`)
  - `subscription.get` (`7abeebee372f304e050aaaf92be863f4a86490e382f8c79db68fd94040d691b4`)

## Usage mapping
- The Go usage API reports `usage.rolling/weekly/monthly.percent` in percentage units (0...100): `1` means 1%, and
  `0.5` means 0.5%. Generic dashboard JSON still accepts fractional usage values (0...1).
- Console meters report micro-cents, not percentages: each of `access.meters.fiveHour/week/month` carries
  `usedMicroCents` and `limitMicroCents`, and the percentage is `100 * used / limit`. A missing or null month reset
  uses the billing period end (`access.endsAt`). Other missing reset timestamps stay unknown, without a countdown.
- Primary window: rolling 5-hour usage (`rollingUsage.usagePercent`, `rollingUsage.resetInSec`).
- Secondary window: optional weekly usage (`weeklyUsage.usagePercent`, `weeklyUsage.resetInSec`).
- Resets computed as `now + resetInSec`.

## Using OpenCode with Codex or OpenAI

Codex account quota and local token/cost history are separate data sources. The Codex provider reads session and
weekly quota from the signed-in account's remote usage endpoint; those percentages do not come from local session
logs.

If OpenCode holds your Codex OAuth session, the explicitly enabled **External Codex OAuth sources** setting can
reuse its `openai` OAuth entry for remote quota. Native Codex credentials take precedence, and an explicit
`CODEX_HOME` prevents external fallback. External credentials stay read-only; stale credentials fail closed, and
API-key entries are ignored. See [Codex external OAuth sources](codex.md#optional-external-oauth-sources-off-by-default).

This does not import OpenCode sessions into Codex token or spend totals. The base OpenCode provider tracks its web
dashboard, while the local SQLite reader described here selects only `opencode-go` assistant records for OpenCode Go.
Ordinary OpenCode sessions using OpenAI/Codex are not currently included in local cost history. OpenAI API-platform
usage is a separate [OpenAI provider](openai.md), not Codex subscription quota.

## Notes
- OpenCode Go token accounts accept raw API keys as well as existing Cookie headers. Add each key with its own
  label under **OpenCode Go accounts**; the selected account controls the single-account view, and the stacked
  submenu or `codexbar usage --provider opencodego --all-accounts` reads each account separately. In Auto mode,
  raw keys use the public usage API without browser cookies or device-wide local history. A failed key stays an
  account-local error. Explicit `--source api` or `--source web` still selects that source.
- Cookie headers containing `name=value` retain their manual web path. Keys are plain tokens without whitespace,
  `=`, or `:`; surrounding quotes and whitespace are removed. Selected accounts override the provider-wide API
  key and `OPENCODE_API_KEY`; selecting a Cookie account clears those API credentials for that fetch. Existing
  single-key setups without token accounts are unchanged.
- Adding, selecting, editing, or removing API key accounts preserves the saved cookie source, so Automatic browser
  imports remain available after the final API key account is removed. Cookie accounts select Manual; API key
  accounts also preserve an existing Manual choice.
- Legacy responses are `text/javascript` with serialized objects; Console responses are JSON.
- Missing workspace ID or rolling usage fields should raise parse errors; omitted weekly usage stays absent.
- OpenCode web Auto imports Chrome first, then Dia when their cookie stores exist; Keychain preflight stays scoped
  to each candidate browser. Other browsers stay on Manual Cookie import until CodexBar has an explicit browser
  selector.
- Set `CODEXBAR_OPENCODE_WORKSPACE_ID` to skip workspace lookup and force a specific workspace.
- Workspace override accepts a raw `wrk_…` ID or a full `https://opencode.ai/workspace/...` URL. OpenCode Go also
  accepts Console `org_…` IDs and `https://opencode.ai/console/...` URLs.
- Console migration: OpenCode redirects migrated workspaces from `opencode.ai/workspace/<id>` to the console,
  which serves an empty client-rendered shell, so the legacy scraped payload is absent. Web reads try the
  console API first and fall back to the legacy page when a legacy session cookie is present. The two sessions
  expire independently; a Console rejection or recoverable transport failure does not discard usable legacy
  authentication. Cancellation and certificate failures do not trigger fallback. Console HTTP 401 means signed out;
  scope and permission failures such as HTTP 403 remain API failures and are never inferred from page text.
- A successful Console Go response of `null` or `access: null` has no subscription windows. Prepaid PAYG accounts
  still report their Zen balance, including zero or negative balances. Other billing modes remain unsupported by
  this Console balance mapping. A failed optional balance read does not discard valid Go usage.
- Cached cookies: Keychain cache `com.steipete.codexbar.cache` (account `cookie.opencode`, source + timestamp). Browser
  import only runs when the cached cookie fails.
- OpenCode Go unscoped Auto mode tries daily cost history derived from local `opencode-go` assistant costs first,
  overlays authoritative API windows when an API key is configured, then falls back through the API and legacy web
  sources when local history is unavailable. Auto stays web-first when a Cookie token account, manual cookie, or workspace
  override scopes the request, because local history is device-wide.
- The local monthly window is an estimate anchored at the earliest local row and can drift from the real billing
  cycle. The local strategy prefers API-reported rolling/weekly/monthly percentages and reset timestamps. When no API
  key is configured, a cached or manual session cookie can still overlay the legacy web values (plus Zen balance).
  Both paths keep local daily cost history and never trigger a fresh browser import. When no authoritative overlay is
  available, the menu and text CLI label the quota as estimated, and JSON includes `dataConfidence: "estimated"`.
  Estimated quota keeps its percentages and reset dates but does not show pace, reserve, or run-out advice in the
  menu, menu-bar layouts, or CLI; device-local costs cannot establish account-wide consumption or the billing cycle.
- OpenCode Go Monthly usage can be selected in the menu-bar percentage picker and layout palette before the first
  snapshot arrives. Missing data renders a dash. Percentage selection leaves pace, resets, and custom tokens independent;
  custom layouts with both ordinary percentages and an independently placed Monthly percentage use the layout editor
  for that mixed selection.
- OpenCode Go cost history chart: `opencode.ai` has no daily-granularity endpoint, so per-day cost/request buckets
  come from local `opencode-go` assistant costs in `opencode.db`, keyed by device-local calendar day. Successful web
  usage remains workspace-scoped and is never blended with device-wide local costs, so it does not show cost history.
  Explicit Web mode never reads the local database either.
- Each day's bucket also carries a per-model cost breakdown, read from each local assistant message's `modelID`
  (the real model behind the constant `opencode-go` Zen proxy `providerID`). This lets the shared Cost history
  chart show a per-model breakdown for OpenCode Go the same way it already does for Claude (see the "Cost usage"
  section in [docs/claude.md](claude.md)). Rows with no `modelID` are grouped under an "unknown" bucket instead of
  being dropped.
- Local history also includes recorded input, output, reasoning, cache-read, cache-write, and total tokens per day
  and model. Step-finish parts take precedence over their parent message so multi-step sessions are not counted
  twice. Explicit totals are used as recorded; older rows without a total sum the five complete token components.
  Missing, malformed, negative, or overflowing counts remain unknown rather than becoming zero. A day containing
  a row without usable tokens has no complete token total. These device-local counts add history detail only:
  they do not change account quota, and costs still come from the recorded `cost` field, never token pricing.
