# LithosAI

Enable LithosAI in Settings → Providers. Sign in at <https://console.lithosai.cloud> in Chrome and use the
provider's refresh action to import the session when browser access is allowed. Automatic import is Chrome-only and follows the host's
browser-access gate. Alternatively choose Manual and paste a Cookie request header containing
both `__Host-console_session` and `__Host-console_csrf` from the same signed-in console session. Manual cookies
are stored in the CodexBar config file. Inference API keys cannot read console billing.

The bundled plugin shows the active organization's prepaid USD balance, payment-card state, account hold state,
and optional today/month-to-date spend in UTC. Money fields use **1 USD = 1,000,000,000 nanos**. Sparse spend rows
are summed across models and keys; a successful empty report means zero spend. An unavailable or malformed spend
report leaves the balance visible and labels spend unavailable. There is no invented quota percentage, budget,
or reset date. Negative balances remain visible, and positive amounts below one cent are labeled explicitly.

Read-only console GETs:

- `/api/me` supplies the user and active organization.
- `/api/billing` supplies `balanceNanos`, `hasCard`, and `onHold`.
- `/api/billing/spend?start=YYYY-MM-DD&end=YYYY-MM-DD` supplies the inclusive UTC month-to-date range.

Billing requests echo the active organization ID as `X-Organization-Id`. The host, not the script, echoes
`__Host-console_csrf` as `X-Console-Csrf` from the selected session and only on the declared HTTPS console origin.
Cookie values remain opaque to JavaScript. Both cookies must match the request URL; no persistent session cache
is added. HTTP 401 rejects that session and tries the next profile; 403 reports denied access without evicting it.

CLI: `codexbar usage --provider lithosai --source web --json`. On Linux use a manual cookie header in the config;
automatic Chrome import is macOS-only. No API key or separate login command is needed.

The undocumented console contract was documented by @apoorvdarshan in
[#3868](https://github.com/steipete/CodexBar/issues/3868). Their
[reference client](https://github.com/apoorvdarshan/lithosai-bar) was consulted for protocol semantics;
CodexBar implements its own plugin and uses synthetic fixtures, without importing the client's code.
