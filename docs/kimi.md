# Kimi Code Provider

Tracks usage for [Kimi For Coding](https://www.kimi.com/code) in CodexBar.

Kimi Code is distinct from the Moonshot/Kimi Open Platform. China-issued Open Platform keys and balance
belong under **Moonshot / Kimi Open Platform** with the China mainland region selected; they are not Kimi
Code subscription credentials.

## Features

- Displays weekly request quota (from membership tier)
- Shows current 5-hour rate limit usage
- Displays membership from the API/CLI usage response, with the active web subscription title as a fallback
- Detects the installed Kimi CLI version, including standalone installs outside the GUI app PATH
- Enriches Code API/CLI usage with the monthly membership pool when a web session is available
- Automatic menu-bar usage prioritizes an exhausted monthly Total usage pool over reset Code windows; explicit window selections remain authoritative
- When a known monthly Total usage pool is exhausted, the menu card marks shorter Code windows as blocked by the monthly limit and omits their pace forecasts. Raw API percentages and explicit menu-bar selections remain available; unknown or expired monthly limits do not block the card.
- API-key, Kimi Code CLI, automatic cookie, and manual cookie authentication methods
- Multiple labeled web accounts through the shared token-account editor
- Automatic refresh countdown

## Setup

Select **Region** in Settings → Providers → Kimi before configuring credentials. **China (kimi.com)** is
the default, preserving existing installs; **International (kimi.ai)** selects the overseas service.
The selection controls Code API requests, web membership requests, browser/Desktop cookie discovery,
Open Console, and Usage Dashboard. Use an API key or manual token issued for the selected region.

The app and CLI share the `providers[].region` config key:

```json
{"id":"kimi","region":"international","source":"api","apiKey":"<REDACTED>"}
```

Use `"china"` for China or omit `region` to keep the default. The regional Code bases are
`https://api.kimi.com/coding/v1` and `https://api.kimi.ai/coding/v1`; consoles are
`https://www.kimi.com/code/console` and `https://www.kimi.ai/code/console`.
Examples below use China URLs; International uses the corresponding `kimi.ai` hosts.

Choose one of four authentication methods:

### Method 1: Kimi Code API Key (Recommended)

Create an API key in the [Kimi Code Console](https://www.kimi.com/code/console), then save it in CodexBar:

```bash
codexbar config set-api-key --provider kimi --api-key "kimi-api-key-here"
```

Or provide it through the environment:

```bash
export KIMI_CODE_API_KEY="kimi-code-api-key-here"
```

CodexBar calls `GET https://api.kimi.com/coding/v1/usages` with the API key. Set
`KIMI_CODE_BASE_URL` only when testing a compatible HTTPS proxy or alternate host with an explicit API key.
CodexBar never forwards a Kimi Code CLI credential to an endpoint override or to the International host.

Both the older count-based response and the newer `usages` ratio pools are supported. Ratio pools take
precedence for the 5-hour, weekly, and monthly Total usage windows they provide. Missing windows stay
absent; percentages retain the API's precision and do not imply request counts. The monthly Total usage
pool is available directly from the Code API, without requiring browser authentication, and optional web
enrichment cannot replace it. Legacy rate-limit counts remain available when no 5-hour ratio is reported.
For mixed legacy responses with a reliable weekly count and no monthly ratio pool, a zero 5-hour or
weekly ratio falls back to a populated count for the same duration and reset time (within two seconds).
Nonzero ratios and monthly-pool responses keep their precedence; mismatched reset periods never borrow counts.
Numeric legacy fields outside the integer range decode safely; unusable request counts do not create quota windows.

### Method 2: Kimi Code CLI

In the default China region, if you are signed in with the official Kimi Code CLI, Auto mode can reuse its fresh access token from
`~/.kimi-code/credentials/kimi-code.json`. CodexBar sends the same device identity headers as the CLI,
including the local hostname, OS details, and stable `~/.kimi-code/device_id` value. If that device ID is
missing, CodexBar creates it with private file permissions to match the official client.

CodexBar treats CLI-owned authentication as read-only: it never uses the refresh token and never rewrites
the credential file. Kimi rotates refresh tokens, so refreshing only in CodexBar's memory could invalidate
the CLI's saved token; writing it back could race with the CLI's own renewal. The official CLI coordinates
renewal and persists the replacement credential itself.

CLI access tokens are short-lived. For a 15-minute token, CodexBar's 60-second safety margin means it
becomes stale after 14 minutes without CLI renewal. Run `kimi` to renew it (sign in if the CLI asks), then
refresh CodexBar. The next fetch rereads the file; restarting CodexBar is unnecessary. Auto mode tries
configured web authentication when the CLI credential is stale or rejected, and prefers a configured API
key before the CLI. For unattended use, add a Kimi Code API key in **Settings → Providers → Kimi** or set
`KIMI_CODE_API_KEY`. Set `KIMI_CODE_HOME` only when the official CLI uses a non-default home directory.

Custom `KIMI_CODE_BASE_URL`, `KIMI_CODE_OAUTH_HOST`, and `KIMI_OAUTH_HOST` values disable CLI credential
reuse; use an explicit API key for endpoint-override testing.
The current CLI credential file does not identify its issuing host, so switching to International disables
automatic CLI credential reuse. Configure an International API key or use a `kimi.ai` web session instead.

### Method 3: Automatic Browser Import

**No setup needed!** If you're already logged in to Kimi in Arc, Chrome, Safari, Edge, Brave, or Chromium:

1. Open CodexBar settings → Providers → Kimi
2. Set "Cookie source" to "Automatic"
3. Enable the Kimi provider toggle
4. CodexBar will automatically find your session

Automatic mode prefers a usable Kimi Desktop cookie. Expired desktop JWTs are skipped; if the server
rejects a desktop session, the Web source continues through browser profiles instead of stopping.
Explicit manual tokens remain authoritative. API-key and CLI quota responses include the membership level, so displaying the tier does not require
browser access. A web session can supply a subscription title when the usage response omits membership;
a membership lookup failure does not fail the quota query. Quota statistics and the optional plan title
load independently within a shared two-second enrichment budget; a slow title cannot discard completed
monthly or Code 7-day statistics. Cancellation stops automatic retries before further browser reads.

**Note**: Requires Full Disk Access to read browser cookies (System Settings → Privacy & Security → Full Disk Access → CodexBar).

Automatic mode also checks the official Kimi Desktop app before importing browser cookies. Its Chromium
Cookies database is opened read-only: active WAL databases use SQLite's normal WAL-aware path, while idle
WAL-mode databases with no sidecars use an immutable read-only fallback. CodexBar never creates or modifies
Kimi Desktop database files.

For the selected region, Automatic mode also reads `access_token` from Chromium browser local storage
through the shared browser catalog after cookie discovery. Tokens stay bound to the selected Kimi origin;
expired or malformed tokens are skipped. CodexBar never reads or refreshes browser refresh tokens. Open
Kimi in your browser to renew an expired session, or use a Kimi Code API key for unattended use.
Safari and Firefox local storage are not imported.

### Method 4: Manual Token Entry

For advanced users or when automatic import fails:

1. Open CodexBar settings → Providers → Kimi
2. Set "Cookie source" to "Manual"
3. Visit `https://www.kimi.com/code/console` in your browser
4. Open Developer Tools (F12 or Cmd+Option+I)
5. Go to **Application** → **Cookies**
6. Copy the `kimi-auth` cookie value (JWT token). On kimi.ai, copy `access_token` from **Local Storage** instead.
7. Paste it into the "Auth Token" field in CodexBar

Manual mode never imports Desktop or browser credentials, including when the token field is empty or invalid.
An explicit cookie environment variable can still supply the web token.

### Multiple Web Accounts

In Settings → Providers → Kimi, use **Kimi accounts** to add a label and either the `kimi-auth`
token value or a Cookie header for each account. Select an account in the existing account list or
use the shared multi-account display controls. The CLI supports `--account <label>`,
`--account-index <index>`, and `--all-accounts` for the same saved accounts, including on Linux.
Manual account cookies use HTTP directly and do not require browser-cookie import support.

Saved accounts use the web usage source with their own manual cookie, even when **Usage source** is
Auto or API key and **Cookie source** is Automatic or Off. These overrides apply only to the fetch;
your saved source preferences and single-account credentials are preserved. Removing the final account
restores those preferences. Invalid or expired account cookies fail for that account without importing
another browser/Desktop session or falling back to an environment credential.

All saved Kimi accounts use the provider's selected **Region**. Add accounts issued for that region;
the account list does not support mixing China and International credentials. Accounts and labels use
the existing `providers[].tokenAccounts` configuration, with no separate Kimi credential store.

### Cookie Environment Variable

Alternatively, set the `KIMI_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable:

```bash
export KIMI_AUTH_TOKEN="jwt-token-here"
```

## Authentication Priority

When multiple sources are available, CodexBar uses this order:

1. API key (`providers[].apiKey` or `KIMI_CODE_API_KEY`) in Auto mode
2. Fresh Kimi Code CLI access token (`~/.kimi-code/credentials/kimi-code.json`)
3. Manual cookie/token (from Settings UI) when web fallback is used
4. Cookie environment variable (`KIMI_AUTH_TOKEN`)
5. Kimi Desktop `kimi-auth` cookie
6. Browser cookies (Arc → Chrome → Safari → Edge → Brave → Chromium)
7. Chromium local storage `access_token` for the selected region

For Code API and CLI results, sources 3–7 are best-effort enrichment only: the required Code usage remains
available if the membership request fails. Setting **Cookie source** to **Off** disables this enrichment and
does not inspect Kimi Desktop or browser cookies.

**Note**: Browser cookie import requires Full Disk Access permission.

Setting **Cookie source** to **Off** prevents browser import on every Kimi path. Context-free token resolution is
limited to explicit environment values; only the provider's settings-aware web strategy may inspect browsers.

## Troubleshooting

### "Kimi auth token is missing"
- Ensure "Cookie source" is set correctly
- If using Automatic mode, verify you're logged in to Kimi in your browser
- Grant Full Disk Access permission if using browser cookies
- Try Manual mode and paste your token directly

### "Kimi auth token is invalid or expired"
- Your token has expired. Paste a new token from your browser
- If using Automatic mode, log in to Kimi again in your browser

### "No Kimi session cookies found"
- You're not logged in to Kimi in any supported browser
- Grant Full Disk Access to CodexBar in System Settings

### "Failed to parse Kimi usage data"
- The API response format may have changed. Please report this issue.
