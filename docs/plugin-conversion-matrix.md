# Provider plugin conversion matrix

This matrix evaluates 69 providers in the current capability audit against the prototype documented in
[`plugin-prototype.md`](plugin-prototype.md). Each provider has one primary blocker. This pass re-audits the remaining convertible and cookie rows;
other legacy classifications still need their own parity audit.

`convertible-now` means the canonical first-party flow fits the current HTTP GET/JSON or form POST, declared-origin,
authentication, and generic snapshot capabilities. Text decoding and dependent requests can be implemented in the
script. Settings-derived origins include the private-network HTTP policy for LLM Proxy and LiteLLM.

`converted` means the bundled conversion is present behind `CODEXBAR_JS_PROVIDERS=1`. `cut-over` means the script is
authoritative on its supported engines; each row states whether a Linux native core remains. Totals count only the
69 audit rows below, excluding the separately listed plugin-first additions. The registry now contains 90 providers:
69 audit rows, 11 additional plugin-first rows, and 10 providers not yet classified in this matrix (CodeRabbit,
Hugging Face, IBM Bob, Muse, Nous, Pi, Replicate, TypeSafe, and v0).

`needs-cookie-import` now means **additional cookie/session capability**, not absence of cookie import. The current
broker imports declared domains, caches each domain separately (#3815), and offers policy-only
`ctx.browser.availability`. It now offers origin-bound candidate iteration and same-refresh advancement after rejection (#3933).
Notion and ZoomMate now use the declared validated-single-entry jar, with host-owned migration and conditional rejection. Remaining cookie rows need individual parity audits for their provider-specific ranking and recovery policies. Availability reports policy, not a validated browser login.
`needs-files/subprocess/oauth-broker` identifies native credential/storage flows beyond that broker.
`needs-host-extension` means another existing native behavior cannot be preserved with the current host APIs.

## Totals

Bundled Swift registration uses `PluginProviderSpec` for the ten pilot providers plus Synthetic, Chutes, v0,
ElevenLabs, Neuralwatt, ClawRouter, Aixy, Bifrost, Deepgram, LLM Proxy, LiteLLM, sub2api, and llmman. ClawRouter keeps
its custom app endpoint field. The other twelve additions share app settings builders; provider-owned endpoint
validation and the bundled scripts remain authoritative. This glue migration does not change the conversion
classifications or registry count below.

Eight cookie/web providers also use the spec: Helmcode, Hyper, Manus, Perplexity, Qoder, Raycast, Sakana, and T3 Chat,
bringing that batch to **31** declarative providers. Six share the cookie app implementation; Helmcode and Qoder retain small
provider-owned UI adapters. Replicate and TypeSafe keep their native conditional session-cache strategies. Cookie
domains, session candidates, regional origins, browser policy, and bundled scripts are unchanged.

Hugging Face, Nous, Fireworks, xAI, Venice, and Zed bring the declarative total to **37**. Hugging Face and xAI use the shared API-key
app implementation; native credential/runtime, persistence, and source-selection adapters remain provider-owned.
Moonshot's config normalizer, z.ai's custom pace rules, and OpenRouter's credit capability remain outside the spec.
OpenAI API also retains its exact decimal branding and custom cost/card presentation. This batch leaves those four,
Abacus, Muse, LongCat, Replicate, and TypeSafe unchanged.

## Matrix

| Provider | Status | Converted | Reason |
|---|---|:---:|---|
| codex | `needs-pty/webview/native` | No | PTY CLI, OAuth files/refresh, browser cookies, WKWebView scraping, local logs, and reset-credit details exceed this host. |
| openai | `cut-over` | Yes | Both engines use the bundled script for Admin API history, project scoping, and legacy billing fallback; the allowlisted typed card preserves the native dashboard and source labels. Native fetchers are deleted. |
| azureopenai | `needs-pty/webview/native` | No | The current quota probe is a POST chat completion against a user-configured deployment origin. |
| claude | `needs-files/subprocess/oauth-broker` | No | Full parity needs credential files/Keychain, OAuth refresh, CLI/PTY, cookies, local logs, and admin details. |
| fireworks | `cut-over` | Yes | Both engines use the bundled script for account discovery and billing spend, including empty results, dynamic source labels, and allowlisted app/CLI slug persistence with save diagnostics. Native fetcher is deleted. |
| clinepass | `cut-over` | Yes | Cut over on both engines: fixed-origin bearer GET, typed quota lanes, credential aliases, and classified failures match native behavior; Swift reads the existing Cline auth-session file without refreshing or persisting credentials. The Swift fetcher and Linux fixtures are deleted. |
| cursor | `needs-files/subprocess/oauth-broker` | No | Native app-auth SQLite discovery and local CSV usage remain required; domain cookies do not replace those sources. |
| opencode | `needs-cookie-import` | No | Same-refresh candidate rejection is supported, but native import merges two cookie domains into one cache entry; domain-scoped plugin imports can stage two writes, which interactive refresh cannot commit atomically (#3982). |
| opencodego | `needs-files/subprocess/oauth-broker` | No | Local auth/SQLite state and browser sessions are required, with an additional bespoke usage model. |
| alibaba | `needs-host-extension` | No | Form POST is available in host-caps-3; CSRF/sec-token parsing stays in the script. Cookie-jar lane host-caps-4 owns redirect-scoped cookies and the remaining session parity audit; not yet convertible. |
| alibabatokenplan | `needs-host-extension` | No | Form POST is available in host-caps-3. Cookie-jar lane host-caps-4 must preserve domain/path metadata through redirects and define legacy-header migration before cutover. |
| qwencloud | `needs-host-extension` | No | Form POST is available in host-caps-3. Cookie-jar lane host-caps-4 owns declared-origin redirects, dashboard/API domain/path routing, final-URL proof, and migration of the native paired-header cache; no cutover here. |
| factory | `needs-files/subprocess/oauth-broker` | No | The canonical fallback recovers WorkOS tokens from browser localStorage and persists sessions; cookie headers cover only part of auth. |
| gemini | `needs-files/subprocess/oauth-broker` | No | Gemini CLI credential/config files, Google OAuth refresh, and a curl fallback own the current flow. |
| antigravity | `needs-pty/webview/native` | No | Process/port discovery, localhost IDE RPC, OAuth files, and a persistent PTY make this a native integration. |
| copilot | `needs-files/subprocess/oauth-broker` | No | Full parity includes stored token discovery and interactive device authorization with form-encoded POST; billing cookies alone are insufficient. |
| devin | `needs-files/subprocess/oauth-broker` | No | Full auth discovery reads Chromium localStorage and organization state; manual bearer alone is partial. |
| zai | `cut-over` | Yes | Cut over on both engines: regional and validated override endpoints, personal/team settings, quota lanes, model totals, and hourly/daily token charts; dashboard routing remains native and the fetch twin is deleted. |
| minimax | `needs-files/subprocess/oauth-broker` | No | Full auth recovery includes browser localStorage and group/session state, beyond declared-domain cookie headers. |
| manus | `cut-over` | Yes | Both engines iterate rejected cached/browser sessions before environment fallback, preserving manual/off policy, JSON POST, sparse credits, and reset details. The native fetcher and cookie importer are deleted. |
| kimi | `needs-files/subprocess/oauth-broker` | No | Credential/device files and desktop token discovery remain native; domain cookies cover only the web account path. |
| kilo | `needs-files/subprocess/oauth-broker` | No | The default source reads Kilo's local auth file and organization metadata. |
| kiro | `needs-pty/webview/native` | No | Usage exists only through bounded CLI pipe/PTY automation and a bespoke credit/overage model. |
| vertexai | `needs-files/subprocess/oauth-broker` | No | ADC/gcloud files, OAuth refresh, optional subprocess fallback, and local cost logs are required. |
| augment | `needs-files/subprocess/oauth-broker` | No | The preferred strategy spawns `auggie`; the alternative imports browser cookies and maintains sessions. |
| jetbrains | `needs-pty/webview/native` | No | There is no HTTP strategy; native IDE discovery and local XML parsing are the provider. |
| moonshot | `cut-over` | Yes | Both engines use the bundled TypeScript plugin for regional bearer GET and identity-only balances, preserving USD/CNY rounding and negative zero. Swift resolves region-bound credentials; the native fetcher is deleted. |
| amp | `needs-files/subprocess/oauth-broker` | No | CLI subprocess and browser-cookie strategies plus workspace credit details are outside this host. |
| t3chat | `cut-over` | Yes | Both engines preserve the 60-second default web timeout (bounded to 90 seconds), safe captured cURL headers, JSONL parsing, and base/overage windows. The native fetcher and parser are deleted. |
| ollama | `needs-cookie-import` | No | HTML parsing and API-key arbitration fit scripts, but automatic auth tries multiple browser-session candidates and preserves browser access diagnostics. |
| synthetic | `cut-over` | Yes | Cut over on both engines: fixed-origin bearer GET with generic windows, cost, dates, and identity; the native fetch twin is deleted. |
| warp | `needs-pty/webview/native` | No | Legacy classification pending a separate parity audit: GraphQL JSON POST is now supported, so the former GET-only rationale no longer establishes a blocker. |
| openrouter | `cut-over` | Yes | Cut over on JavaScriptCore: endpoint and client-header overrides plus one-second best-effort key enrichment match native behavior; the native fetch core is Linux-only. |
| elevenlabs | `cut-over` | Yes | Cut over on both engines: xi-api-key GET, validated endpoint overrides, subscription/voice windows, reset dates, and safe current/legacy auth diagnostics; the Swift fetch twin is deleted. |
| windsurf | `needs-files/subprocess/oauth-broker` | No | Chromium localStorage, IDE databases, and binary protobuf decoding supply the current session. |
| zed | `cut-over` | Yes | Editor and opt-in browser billing HTTP/parsing run in the plugin on both engines. Swift retains editor settings and named Keychain credentials; manual browser billing also works on Linux. |
| perplexity | `cut-over` | Yes | Both engines use the bundled script for candidate retries, bare-token cookie names, chunk assembly, environment fallback, and recurring/bonus/purchased credit windows. Native fetching and projection are deleted. |
| mimo | `needs-files/subprocess/oauth-broker` | No | The canonical pipeline includes the file-based local usage fallback as well as browser sessions; cookies alone cannot preserve it. |
| doubao | `needs-files/subprocess/oauth-broker` | No | Full parity needs a CLI subprocess or Volcengine HMAC signing and POST-based plan calls. |
| sakana | `cut-over` | Yes | Both engines use the bundled billing/PAYG parser and generic details. The host runs concurrent GETs with a shared 200 ms collection budget, a five-second optional request limit, and cancellation of unfinished work. The native fetcher and snapshot twin are deleted. |
| abacus | `cut-over` | Yes | Both engines use the bundled plugin for required credits GET plus optional billing POST, calendar-month pacing, and Chrome-first session fallback. Each credits request uses the configured timeout; at most five candidates share a refresh budget of timeout × 5 plus the billing budget, capped at 90 seconds. Native fetching and snapshot projection are deleted; the session-validating importer remains. |
| mistral | `needs-cookie-import` | No | CSRF extraction and dependent GETs fit scripts, but auth rejection iterates alternate browser profiles and preserves session selection. |
| deepseek | `needs-files/subprocess/oauth-broker` | No | Platform auth/profile selection reads Chromium localStorage, and the result has a bespoke history model. |
| deepinfra | `cut-over` | Yes | Both engines use fixed-origin bearer GETs for required billing data, preserving cents conversion, balance deductions, suspension, spending limits, and bounded retries. The native fetcher and parser are deleted. |
| codebuff | `needs-files/subprocess/oauth-broker` | No | Full credential parity reads a local Manicode credential file; environment-key mode is partial. |
| venice | `cut-over` | Yes | Cut over on JavaScriptCore: fixed-origin bearer GET with DIEM/USD allocation projection; native fetch code is Linux-only. |
| commandcode | `needs-host-extension` | No | Optional subscription enrichment races a two-second grace after required credits finish; per-request timeouts cannot preserve that join boundary. |
| qoder | `cut-over` | Yes | Both engines use the bundled script for regional candidate retries and merged quota parsing. Manual captures bind to one origin; Swift retains capture validation, settings, and source/dashboard presentation only. Native fetching is deleted. |
| stepfun | `needs-files/subprocess/oauth-broker` | No | Device registration, password login, refresh, quota, and plan operations are POST-based token-broker work. |
| bedrock | `needs-files/subprocess/oauth-broker` | No | AWS profiles/CLI credentials, SigV4 signing, pagination, and two services need host-owned credential/signing APIs. |
| grok | `needs-pty/webview/native` | No | Persistent stdio JSON-RPC, auth/session files, cookies, logs, and binary gRPC-web are strongly native. |
| groq | `needs-cookie-import` | No | Stytch JSON POST/JWT decoding fit scripts, but auth selects and retries merged browser-profile sessions; local-calendar history bounds also need parity proof. |
| llmproxy | `cut-over` | Yes | Cut over on both engines: configured HTTPS/private-network HTTP, quota-group variants, aggregate totals, provider summaries, and classified failures; the native fetch twin is deleted. |
| litellm | `cut-over` | Yes | Cut over on both engines: configured HTTPS/private-network HTTP, key-bound user/team lookups, budgets, optional user-scoped model activity, spend-only and identity-only snapshots; the native fetch twin is deleted. |
| bifrost | `cut-over` | Yes | Bundled TypeScript on both engines: configured HTTPS/private-network HTTP, virtual-key header auth, budget overrides, reset-only rate limits, and numeric model/budget details. Swift owns registration and settings only. |
| deepgram | `cut-over` | Yes | Cut over on JavaScriptCore: project discovery, aggregation, configured origins, numeric validation, and classified auth/permission/rate/network/API/parse failures match native behavior; the native fetch core is Linux-only. |
| poe | `cut-over` | Yes | Cut over on both engines: fixed-origin bearer GET balance/history pagination with daily points and model/type summaries; the native fetch twins are deleted. |
| chutes | `cut-over` | Yes | Both engines use the bundled TypeScript plugin for subscription usage and best-effort quota enrichment, preserving empty snapshots and subscription context; the native fetcher is deleted. |
| helmcode | `cut-over` | Yes | Both tenant HTTP flows and quota projection live in the bundled TypeScript plugin, using domain-scoped cookies and policy-only availability. Swift supplies registration, settings, and dashboard routing. No native fetcher or cURL-capture fallback. |
| neuralwatt | `cut-over` | Yes | Cut over on both engines: validated configured HTTPS, subscription kWh, prepaid balance, key allowances, and exact confidence; the host preserves selective single retries, capped Retry-After, and cancellation. The native fetch twin is deleted. |
| clawrouter | `cut-over` | Yes | Cut over on JavaScriptCore: validated configured origins, classified failures, exact confidence, budget/ledger details, and provider charts match native behavior; the native fetch core is Linux-only. |
| longcat | `cut-over` | Yes | Both engines use opaque, nonpersistent per-profile cookie jars with request-URL selection, required account/legacy quota requests, best-effort token-pack/fuel probes, and auth-only profile fallback. Automatic imports remain user-initiated app-only. Native fetcher, importer, cookie-header, and snapshot code are deleted. |
| sub2api | `cut-over` | Yes | Cut over on JavaScriptCore: configured HTTPS/loopback origins, a hard 15-second request deadline, strict parsing, exact confidence, and classified failures match native behavior; the native fetch core is Linux-only. |
| wayfinder | `needs-pty/webview/native` | No | The local unauthenticated HTTP gateway, metrics text, and routing/savings model violate HTTPS-only generic scope. |
| zenmux | `cut-over` | Yes | Both engines use fixed-origin bearer GETs for required subscription quotas and optional USD PAYG balance. Auth failures and cancellation remain fatal during enrichment; the native fetcher and parser are deleted. |
| aiand | `cut-over` | Yes | Both engines use the bundled TypeScript plugin for paired-cursor log pagination, exact decimal sums, partial confidence, and explicit empty windows without a guessed currency; the native fetcher is deleted. |
| zoommate | `cut-over` | Yes | Both engines use the bundled plugin for bootstrap, bearer reuse, host failover, credits, and bounded optional history. The host owns URL-scoped cookies, validated single-entry persistence, and legacy paired-host migration; native fetch/import/header code is deleted. |
| xai | `cut-over` | Yes | Cut over on both engines: bearer GET balance plus best-effort JSON POST history and billing details; the native fetch twins are deleted. |
| notion | `cut-over` | Yes | Both engines preserve workspace selection, identity, allowance windows, and over-quota percentages. The host owns ranked source domains, required token_v2 admission, conditional native-session migration, and refresh commit/rollback; native fetch/import/session code is deleted. |
