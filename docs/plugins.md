# Local provider plugins

CodexBar can load one local JavaScript or TypeScript file as a provider. Put a `.js` or `.ts` file in
`~/.config/codexbar/providers/`, or choose **Settings → Plugins → Install…**. Each file declares its complete authority
and settings schema in a manifest, fetches through CodexBar's sandboxed host API, and returns a generic usage snapshot.

Plugins are local files only. CodexBar has no plugin catalog, does not download plugin code or assets, and does not
resolve imports. A plugin cannot use Node, browser globals, subprocesses, local files, databases, OAuth, WebViews, or
arbitrary native APIs. The maximum source size is 1 MiB.

App refreshes are scoped to the installed plugin runtime and its fetch settings. Disabling, removing, reloading, or
reconfiguring a plugin prevents an older refresh from publishing usage or errors. A replacement refresh waits for retired
work to finish and reads the current configuration when its fetch starts. Display-only preferences do not invalidate usage.

## Bundled provider registration

For a bundled plugin with a simple API-key configuration, declare a public `PluginProviderSpec` named `spec` in its
provider-owned `*ProviderDescriptor.swift` file, then expose `descriptor = Self.spec.makeDescriptor()`. The spec owns
metadata, branding, environment-key aliases, the API-key field, and optional presentation and script-settings overrides;
the bundled script still owns requests and parsing. See `XKiroProviderDescriptor` for a minimal example and
`ZenMuxProviderDescriptor` for optional usage settings. Optional dashboards, subscription links, plan labels,
widget colors, and progress colors retain their provider-owned values. `V0ProviderDescriptor` demonstrates a
workspace field shared by config projection, plugin settings, and the app's Scope field.

`Endpoint` shares the `enterpriseHost` projection, environment key, Base URL field, and validated URL resolver.
Its requirement distinguishes a configured override (including invalid values that must reach fetch validation),
a validated override, and an optional override with a declared default. URL normalization and validation remain in
the provider-owned reader. Deepgram's environment-only API URL override stays separate from its Project ID field;
it does not gain an `enterpriseHost` setting.

Typed Boolean toggles share config reads/writes, environment projection, app bindings, and an optional enabled
fetch timeout; LiteLLM uses this for model activity. Only llmman opts out of requiring an API key for fetching.
The `plugin-provider-specs.json` golden keeps builder-derived credential projections, source modes and strategy IDs,
field kinds, availability, CLI alias mappings, and config capabilities. Before another migration, capture the full
pre-migration descriptor and settings output separately and compare it after the change; keep that equivalence proof
in the PR. Do not expand the committed golden with copied labels, colors, or other spec literals.

Run `Scripts/regenerate-provider-manifests.sh` after wiring the provider. A spec with an `apiKeyField` and no separate
app implementation registers `PluginAPIKeyProviderImplementation(spec: ...)` in the existing provider order. Preserve
the provider's availability and detail-line policies explicitly. Providers with extra fields or token-account behavior
can share the descriptor builder while retaining their app implementation, as GitKraken and DeepInfra do. Keep native
credential discovery in provider-owned adapters. ClinePass supplies
provider-owned credential and fetch-plan overrides to `makeDescriptor` for its read-only Cline session file, while
retaining the spec's API-key path, metadata, and shared settings field.

`WebSource` adds typed web-only or session/API source modes, browser import order, settings registration, timeout
policy, and manual-cookie fields. `PluginCookieProviderImplementation` shares the picker, field, observation,
login link, and manual token-account behavior. The existing `ProviderSettingsSectionRegistration` passes each
provider's typed cookie snapshot to the broker, including the manual origin used for regional session candidates.
Cookie domains and session capabilities remain authoritative in the unchanged bundled manifest; the shared
`ScriptFetchStrategy` passes those declarations through to the broker without widening them.

Manus, Perplexity, Hyper, Raycast, Sakana, and T3 Chat use the shared app implementation. Helmcode retains its tenant
picker/snapshot, and Qoder retains its regional dashboard action and source-label adapter while sharing cookie UI.
Provider-owned values resolvers retain token normalization and captured-header allowlists. Replicate and TypeSafe
remain outside this spec migration: their native strategies publish cookies conditionally after a successful fetch,
honor pinned-account fallback, and enforce their existing redirect policies.

## Minimal plugin

```js
defineProvider({
  id: "acme-usage",
  name: "Acme Usage",
  icon: { monogram: "AC", tint: "#336699" },
  endpoints: ["https://api.example.com"],
  auth: { type: "bearer", secret: "API_KEY" },
  settings: [
    { key: "API_KEY", title: "API key", subtitle: "Create one in Acme settings.", type: "secure" },
  ],
  async fetchUsage(ctx) {
    const response = await ctx.http.getJSON("https://api.example.com/v1/usage");
    return {
      primary: {
        usedPercent: response.json.used_percent,
        resetsAt: response.json.resets_at,
        windowMinutes: 300,
      },
      details: [{
        title: "Usage",
        rows: [{ label: "Requests", value: String(response.json.requests) }],
      }],
    };
  },
});
```

## Manifest reference

`defineProvider` must be called exactly once with an object containing:

- `id`: 1–64 lowercase ASCII letters, digits, or hyphens. It must not match a built-in provider or another installed
  plugin.
- `name`: trimmed display name, 1–80 UTF-8 bytes.
- `icon` (optional): `{monogram, tint}`. `monogram` is 1–3 characters; `tint` is `#RRGGBB`. The fallback is the first
  letter of `name` with a neutral tint. File/SVG icons are not supported.
- `topLevel` (optional, default `true`): gives an enabled plugin its own provider-switcher tab when Merge Icons is on. Set to `false` to keep an appended card.
- `endpoints`: 1–16 declared network origins. A fixed endpoint is a normalized HTTPS origin such as
  `https://api.example.com` (no path, query, fragment, or user info). A settings-derived endpoint is
  `{setting: "BASE_URL", policy: "https"}`, `{setting: "BASE_URL", policy: "https-or-loopback-http"}`, or
  `{setting: "BASE_URL", policy: "https-or-private-network-http"}`. Its setting must be declared as `plain`.
  `https-or-loopback-http` preserves the unauthenticated loopback-only rule. `https-or-private-network-http` also permits
  authenticated HTTP for loopback, RFC 1918 IPv4, IPv4 link-local, IPv6 unique-local/link-local, and `.local` targets,
  but only through the separate typed approval described below. Public targets always require HTTPS.
- `auth` (optional): one of the forms below. The named secret must be a declared `secure` setting.
- `settings`: up to 32 setting definitions. Keys contain 1–64 ASCII letters, digits, or underscores and start with a
  letter. Each entry has `key`, `title`, optional `subtitle`, and `type: "plain" | "secure"` (default `secure`).
- `capabilities` (optional): `"browser-cookies"`, `"http-status"`, and `"persistent-storage"`. With `"http-status"`, the plugin observes
  non-2xx responses itself instead of the host failing the request.
- `cookieDomains`: required with `browser-cookies`; a non-empty list of normalized DNS host names.
- `fetchUsage(ctx)`: function returning a snapshot or fetch result envelope, or a promise for one.

Authentication forms:

```js
auth: { type: "bearer", secret: "API_KEY" }
auth: { type: "x-api-key", secret: "API_KEY" }
auth: { type: "header", header: "X-Custom-Key", secret: "API_KEY" }
auth: { type: "authorization-scheme", scheme: "Token", secret: "API_KEY" }
```

The host owns the authentication header; plugin request options cannot override it. Authenticated public origins must be
HTTPS; authenticated private-network HTTP requires `https-or-private-network-http` plus typed approval. Secure settings
can be overridden for CLI use with
`CODEXBAR_PLUGIN_<PLUGIN_ID>_<SETTING_KEY>`, uppercased with non-alphanumeric characters replaced by underscores. For
example, `acme-usage` and `API_KEY` use `CODEXBAR_PLUGIN_ACME_USAGE_API_KEY`.

## `ctx` API

`ctx` exists only during `fetchUsage`. CodexBar uses QuickJS-NG 0.17.0 on every platform; both QuickJS and the Apple-only
JavaScriptCore rollback engine provide ECMAScript built-ins but no browser or Node environment. `Intl` is
engine-dependent and unavailable in QuickJS,
so portable third-party plugins must use the host helpers below instead of ECMA-402. `fetch`, `XMLHttpRequest`, timers,
`require`, `process`, and filesystem APIs are unavailable.

- `await ctx.http.getJSON(url, opts?)` performs GET and returns `{status, headers, json}`.
- `await ctx.http.get(url, opts?)` performs GET and returns `{status, headers, bodyText}`.
- `await ctx.http.getWithOptional(url, optional, opts?)` runs a required text GET concurrently with an optional
  request through the host. A string `optional` is a GET URL that shares `opts`; an object
  `{url, method: "POST", body, headers?, timeoutSeconds?}` supplies an independent JSON POST, or use `form` instead
  of `body` for a host-encoded form POST. Both requests pass declared-origin/authentication checks before either starts.
  The result is the primary response with `optional` containing the secondary response or `null`.
  Optional work has a five-second request limit and no retries. `opts.optionalBudgetSeconds` selects a shared
  collection budget from zero through five seconds (default 0.2), measured from the first primary attempt's
  admission. Scheduling waits count against the overall fetch timeout, not this collection budget. A slow primary
  only collects an already completed secondary; a fast primary can wait for the remainder of that budget.
  Failed optional work is discarded. Unfinished optional work is cancelled on collection, primary failure, or caller
  cancellation. This works on both engines without JavaScript promise concurrency. HTTP responses expose their final `url`.
- `await ctx.http.postJSON(url, {body, headers?})` performs JSON POST. `body` must be JSON-serializable.
- `await ctx.http.post(url, {body, headers?})` sends the same JSON POST and returns `{status, headers, bodyText}` so a
  plugin can classify non-JSON error pages before parsing a successful response.
- `await ctx.http.post(url, {form: {key: "value"}, headers?})` sends `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` data and
  returns the text response, including its final `url`. The host encodes a string-to-string map; raw form strings,
  non-string values, and combining `form` with `body` are rejected. Form requests use the same declared-origin,
  authentication, deadline, response-size, and retry rules as JSON POST. Form values, their percent-encoded values,
  and their JSON-escaped values join the fetch's log/error redaction set before transport starts. Do not log
  credentials before submitting the request; values discovered by the script are not known to the host yet.
- `opts.headers` accepts string values. Plugins cannot replace their declared auth header. `opts.timeoutSeconds` sets a
  hard request deadline from 1 through 90 seconds; the default is 15 seconds. Each attempt’s deadline starts when
  its transport task begins, so scheduler delays do not consume the request budget. Queued work remains bounded
  by the overall fetch deadline and cancellation. An override does not extend that overall deadline; bundled
  strategies that need a longer request must also supply a sufficient fetch budget.
- `opts.retryPolicy: "transientIdempotent"` opts GET into the native single-retry policy: 408, 429, 500, 502, 503, 504,
  timeout, lost connection, connection failure, and DNS failures. The delay is one second or numeric `Retry-After`,
  capped at ten seconds. POST, offline, TLS, and cancellation failures are not retried. This replaces the automatic
  status-based fetch replay for that request; explicit `ctx.fail` retry options should not add another retry.
- HTTP rejections are `Error` objects on both engines. Native failures expose `transportCode` (the Foundation URL-error
  code), `transportClass` (`timeout`, `dns`, `offline`, `cancelled`, `tls`, `connection`, or `other`), and `retryable`
  (the code's eligibility for an idempotent retry, not the remaining retry budget).
  Rejected HTTP responses expose `status` and class `http`. Plugins can use these fields when choosing a `ctx.fail`
  classification. Rethrow cancellation unchanged; uncaught cancellation remains a Swift `CancellationError`, and
  cancelling the refresh interrupts its pending request and retry delay.
- `ctx.settings.get(key)` reads a declared `plain` setting.
- `ctx.settings.getSecret(key)` reads a declared `secure` setting. Missing values return `null`; kind mismatches and
  undeclared keys throw.
- `ctx.fail` creates classified errors for `authenticationExpired`, `missingCredential`, `permissionDenied`,
  `rateLimited`, `providerUnavailable`, `parseFailure`, `networkFailure`, and `apiFailure`. Throw the returned error,
  for example `throw ctx.fail.rateLimited("Provider rate limit reached")`; ordinary errors retain generic mapping.
  With `http-status`, classify responses here to request the shared retry described below; use
  `ctx.fail.rateLimited(message, {retryAfterSeconds})` for a provider-specific delay.
- `ctx.browser.availability(domain)` returns `"available"`, `"manual"`, or `"off"` for a declared cookie domain.
  It inspects source/cookie policy only, without accessing the broker, Keychain, or browser. It does not promise a
  usable session. API-only (and other non-web) source modes report `"off"`; Manual reports `"manual"`, so plugins can
  route an origin-less pasted header to one explicitly selected tenant. Missing cookie resolvers report `"off"`.
  `cookieHeader` also enforces Off/API-only policy, even if the plugin skips this check.
- `await ctx.browser.cookieHeader(domain)` returns a cookie header only with the `browser-cookies` capability and for a
  declared domain. User plugins import from Chrome; bundled providers retain their declared browser order.
  Cookie values are secret-equivalent and redacted.
- `for await (const session of ctx.browser.sessions(domain))` visits origin-bound candidates in order: the exclusive
  manual credential, or the cached session followed by browser profiles in the provider's import order. Each candidate
  has `{id, header, source, origin}`. Enumeration is scoped to one declared domain and stops when candidates are exhausted.
  Manual regional captures retain their origin through settings projection; an origin-less legacy header is restricted
  to the selected domain. Qoder's legacy headers select the global site.
  The optional `{cachedOnly: true}` argument yields manual/cached candidates without importing browser profiles;
  cached candidates include `cachedAt` as Unix seconds. This lets a regional provider try its newest cached session
  before importing any fresh cookies, even when that session belongs to its second domain.
- `ctx.browser.rejectCookie(domain, session)` rejects that candidate after an authentication failure. It conditionally
  evicts the matching persistent entry without deleting a newer session or another domain's cache. The opaque candidate
  ID makes late rejections safe. Continuing the iterator visits the next candidate; a successful fetch can return
  immediately. `cookieHeader` remains available for providers needing only one header.
- `ctx.html.metaContent(html, name)` returns the first matching quoted meta value or `null`.
- `ctx.html.matchFirst(html, regexSource, flags?)` returns the first capture/full match or `null`.
- `ctx.log(...values)` writes to the instance-scoped plugin log. Known secrets and cookie values are redacted.
- `ctx.cache.get(key)` and `ctx.cache.set(key, value, ttlSeconds)` provide a per-runtime memory cache. TTL is capped at
  24 hours.
- `ctx.storage.get(key)`, `set(key, value)`, and `remove(key)` provide persistent, non-secret string state with the
  `persistent-storage` capability. Missing keys return `null`; empty string values are valid. Keys must contain
  1–128 UTF-8 bytes, each value at most 16 KiB, and each plugin at most 64 entries and 64 KiB of combined key/value
  UTF-8 bytes. Wrong types and capacity violations throw without changing saved values. Use explicit JSON string
  encoding for structured state. Storage operations are synchronous and immediately durable, including when a later
  part of the fetch fails; they are not a transaction with the returned usage snapshot.
- `ctx.date.now()`, `iso(text)`, `unixSeconds(number)`, and `unixMillis(number)` create JavaScript dates. `now()` uses
  the host refresh clock.
- `ctx.date.nowMillis()` returns the host refresh clock as Unix epoch milliseconds for deterministic arithmetic.
- `ctx.date.nextDailyReset(timeZoneIdentifier, hour)` returns the next wall-clock reset in an IANA time zone.
- `ctx.date.addMonths(date, months, timeZoneIdentifier)` adds an integer number of Gregorian calendar months to a
  valid JavaScript `Date`; use negative months to subtract. Both engines call Foundation Calendar with the specified
  IANA time zone, preserving local wall-clock time across DST and clamping month ends (January 31 plus one month is
  February 28, or February 29 in a leap year). Offsets are limited to ±120,000 months, and invalid dates, time zones,
  fractional offsets, or results outside JavaScript's Date range throw.
- `ctx.env.timeZone` is the host's current IANA time-zone identifier; zero-offset GMT aliases are normalized to `UTC`.
- `ctx.format.number(value, options?)`, `usd(value)`, and `monthDay(date)` provide deterministic formatting on both
  engines. Number options support `minimumFractionDigits` and `maximumFractionDigits`.
- `ctx.format.currency(value, currencyCode)` uses the same native `UsageFormatter` as the app, with `en_US` currency
  symbols and decimal half-even rounding. For USD, `49.585` becomes `$49.58`, `-0.0` becomes `-$0.00`, and `1e-7`
  becomes `$0.00`; CNY uses `CN¥`. No JavaScript `Intl` implementation is required.
- `ctx.jwt.decode(token)` decodes (but does not authenticate) a JWT JSON payload.
- `ctx.pct(used, limit)` returns a finite percentage clamped to 0–100; non-positive limits map to 100.
- `ctx.isDetailLabel(value)` checks the native provider-detail label rules, including whitespace and Unicode character limits; it performs no I/O and returns false for non-strings.

User-plugin requests run in an ephemeral session with no ambient cookies, credential store, or URL cache. Redirects are
rejected, the default request timeout is 15 seconds, `Accept-Encoding: identity` is sent, compressed responses always fail, and response
bytes are capped at 1 MiB. By default, the host rejects non-2xx responses and automatically retries 408, 429, 500, 502,
503, and 504 once, using a numeric `Retry-After` delay or 1 second when absent, clamped to 10 seconds. With `http-status`,
the plugin receives `{status, headers, ...}` and owns classification, including non-numeric `Retry-After`, quota error bodies,
and vendor retry fields. Both paths share one delayed retry budget; cancellation stops the delay. Request URLs must match a declared, approved origin.

```js
capabilities: ["http-status"],
async fetchUsage(ctx) {
  const response = await ctx.http.getJSON("https://api.example.com/usage");
  if (response.status === 429) {
    const retryAfterSeconds = Number(response.headers["retry-after"] || 1);
    throw ctx.fail.rateLimited("Rate limited", { retryAfterSeconds });
  }
}
```

Declaring `http-status` changes the approval binding, so an installed plugin requires re-approval after adding it.
The same applies to `persistent-storage`. The host binds storage to the manifest's instance ID; scripts cannot select
another namespace or file path. App and CLI runtimes share `<resolved config directory>/plugin-storage/<id>.json`.
Writes are atomic, files use mode `0600`, and each operation reloads under a process-shared lock. A busy lock, corrupt
or incompatible file, or I/O failure throws; invalid files are never silently overwritten. Removing a plugin through
the app/CLI manager deletes its state and retires that runtime's storage access. Empty lock files remain for safe
cross-process locking. Removing the source file manually does not delete state. State is unencrypted: credentials,
cookies, and tokens belong in secure settings. Storage does not alter `ctx.cache` or the settings `persist` allowlist.

Bundled first-party providers that have cut over to JavaScript use the shared runtime's 20-second hung-script watchdog.
A timeout fails that refresh and discards the poisoned worker before returning the error, so an immediate retry starts
with a fresh context. Cancellation retires the worker in the same way. This is production-default and does not depend
on `CODEXBAR_JS_PROVIDERS`.
QuickJS enforces the watchdog in-engine with `JS_SetInterruptHandler`, caps the runtime heap at 64 MiB, and caps the
JavaScript stack at 2 MiB. The interrupt terminates evaluation on its confined thread; timed-out scripts do not leave an
abandoned evaluation thread behind. On Apple platforms, `CODEXBAR_PLUGIN_ENGINE=jsc` selects the JavaScriptCore rollback
engine; the same rollback is available in **Settings → Debug → Provider Plugins** and takes effect after restarting
CodexBar. JavaScriptCore has no public interrupt API, so a timed-out rollback-engine context is discarded but its
abandoned evaluation thread can remain alive until process exit.

## Snapshot result

Return at least one rate window, cost object, detail section, or non-empty identity field:

```js
return {
  primary: { usedPercent: 25, resetsAt: new Date(), windowMinutes: 300 },
  secondary: { usedPercent: 40, resetsAt: "2026-08-10T00:00:00Z", windowMinutes: 10080 },
  tertiary: { usedPercent: 5 },
  extraWindows: [{ id: "daily", title: "Daily", window: { usedPercent: 12 } }],
  cost: { used: 8.5, limit: 20, currency: "USD", period: "This month", balance: 11.5 },
  identity: { email: "user@example.com", organization: "Acme", loginMethod: "API key", accountID: "123" },
  subscriptionRenewsAt: "2026-09-01T00:00:00Z",
  dataConfidence: "exact", // exact | estimated | percentOnly | unknown
  details: [{
    title: "Usage summary",
    rows: [{ label: "Requests", value: "1,240", secondaryValue: "Last 30 days" }],
    chart: {
      kind: "bars", // bars | line
      title: "Daily spend",
      unit: "USD",
      points: [{ label: "2026-08-01", value: 4.25 }],
    },
  }],
};
```

Percentages must be finite and are clamped to 0–100. Window minutes are positive integers. Cost requires finite `used`
and a three-letter uppercase currency. Dates are JavaScript `Date` values or ISO-8601 strings. Snapshot identity is
always scoped to the manifest's instance ID. Data confidence defaults to `unknown`. Details allow at most 8 sections, 24 rows per section, 120 chart points,
and 120 characters per detail string. Wrong types and limit violations fail the whole fetch instead of truncating it.
Named extra windows accept an optional `usageKnown` boolean (default `true`). Set it to `false` for reset-only limits:
the window remains visible as **Unavailable**, and its placeholder `usedPercent` is not presented as measured usage.
Detail rows accept optional `progress` (a finite consumed fraction from 0 through 1) and `usageValue` (finite raw usage).
The host maps the fraction to native progress with `used: progress, total: 1`; `usageValue` is preserved independently.
Absent or null numeric fields leave existing text-only rows unchanged. A supplied `usageKnown` must be a boolean,
including when the window uses the nested `window` form; null is invalid.
An identity-only snapshot is useful for balance-only or zero-usage provider states and renders its available account,
organization, plan/login-method, and account-ID fields in the menu and CLI. A verified response with no displayable data
may return `{empty: true}` with optional identity. This creates no artificial rate window; every supplied field is still
validated. An empty object, an empty `identity` object, or metadata such as confidence and subscription dates without
displayable usage or identity remains invalid unless `empty: true` is explicitly declared.

## Fetch result envelope

`fetchUsage` may return a bare snapshot or `{ usage, sourceLabel?, card?, persist? }`. The two forms cannot be mixed;
unknown result and top-level snapshot keys fail validation. Both engines apply the same mapper before any settings write.
Session iteration and candidate rejection work with either result form; the Swift `fetchUsage` and `fetchResult` entry
points both preserve the caller's cookie-session resolver and invalidator.
`sourceLabel` replaces the strategy's default label for that fetch and must contain 1–256 UTF-8 bytes without control
characters. `persist` is an object with at most 16 string values of 1–256 bytes; the descriptor must explicitly allow
every key. Null, arrays, wrong types, unknown keys, and cross-provider requests fail the entire result.

Card payloads are descriptor-owned, never arbitrary Swift decoding. OpenAI's `card.openAIAPIUsage` adapter accepts daily
cost, token, request, model, and line-item history for the existing native chart. It rejects unknown fields, bounds the
history to 366 buckets and 10,000 breakdown entries, and validates finite numbers, safe integer counts, names, and dates.
No other provider or user-installed plugin receives that adapter by declaring a card field.

Fireworks alone allows `persist: { ACCOUNT_SLUG: "discovered-slug" }`. The app/CLI writer rechecks ownership, applies the
provider's allowlist, and returns saved, unchanged, stale, or failed. Successful usage survives a stale or failed save
with a diagnostic. The runtime itself never writes config; a missing writer also reports a failed save. There is no
secret-write capability or arbitrary config-field access.

## TypeScript

`codexbar-plugin.d.ts` in `Sources/CodexBarCore/Resources/Plugins/` is the canonical authoring
contract for `defineProvider`, the `ctx` host API, manifests, and usage snapshots. Bundled plugins may use that contract
directly as `.ts` sources. `Scripts/regenerate-plugin-js.sh` transpiles them with the vendored Sucrase build into
committed sibling `.js` files; the runtime continues to load only those JavaScript files, so bundled TypeScript has no
runtime compilation cost. `make check` verifies both the TypeScript contract and generated-file freshness.

For bundled-plugin work, run `make format` after editing TypeScript so the committed JavaScript is regenerated. Do not
edit a generated sibling `.js` file directly.

TypeScript files are transpiled by the selected plugin engine with the bundled Sucrase 3.35.1 build using its
`typescript` transform. Use ordinary
type syntax but no module imports, JSX, decorators, or runtime TypeScript features that require module resolution.
Transpiled output is cached in `~/Library/Caches/CodexBar/plugins/` under a filename containing the SHA-256 of the source
and the Sucrase version. An unchanged file is a cache hit; any source or compiler-version change produces a new key.
Transpile failures appear as that plugin's Settings error.

## Install, approve, run, and delete

1. Open **Settings → Plugins** and choose **Install…**, or copy one `.js`/`.ts` file into the providers directory.
2. CodexBar validates the source and manifest without network, file, cookie, or secret capabilities.
3. The approval sheet lists exact normalized origins, auth mode, capabilities, secure setting names, and cookie domains.
4. For loopback, IP-literal, or `.local` origins, type every normalized origin exactly before approval.
5. Enter manifest settings and enable the plugin. Its refresh result appears in its generic menu card.

Approval records live outside plugin files under `~/Library/Application Support/CodexBar/plugin-approvals.json`. A
change to instance ID, normalized origins, auth mode/header, secure setting names, capabilities, or cookie domains
invalidates approval before the next request. There is no bulk approval or import path.

Bundled first-party plugins do not use the interactive plugin-approval flow. The private-network HTTP policy is therefore
accepted for bundled code only for LLM Proxy, LiteLLM, Bifrost, and llmman, whose configured endpoints permit exactly those
targets. Other bundled providers fail manifest validation if they request that policy.

`codexbar plugins list` shows locally discovered plugins. `codexbar plugins fetch <id>` displays the same approval
fields and can approve only from an interactive terminal; redirected/headless input fails closed. Browser-cookie plugins
are app-only and fail closed in the CLI.

Every CLI command discovers user plugins before loading config, so `config providers` and `config dump` include
installed plugins. Unrelated app and CLI config writes preserve unavailable plugin records, including settings and
secrets, in their original positions. Missing files, discovery failures, and platforms without the plugin runtime do
not delete saved data. `config providers` labels these entries as `plugin (not loaded)`. Their opaque fields are
redacted in `config dump` unless `--show-secrets` is explicitly requested.
After discovery, entries using an unsupported future config format remain unchanged if an edit would lose data.

Delete from Settings with **Delete…**. CodexBar removes the plugin file, matching TypeScript cache output, approval,
per-instance settings and secrets, and per-instance usage history. Invalid plugin files are listed with their validation
error and can also be deleted.

## Security and limitations

Treat a plugin like code you run locally, even though its host capabilities are narrow. Read the manifest and source,
verify every origin, and avoid installing files from untrusted repositories. Approval grants the listed origin network
authority; DNS changes after approval are outside CodexBar's threat model. Secrets are never placed in URLs or logged,
redirects cannot forward authentication, and undeclared settings/cookies/origins fail closed.

Plugins support the macOS app plus the macOS and Linux CLIs. They are excluded from widgets and all built-in-provider-only
surfaces (status feeds, token accounts, OAuth, browser automation, storage probes, local cost scanners, and provider
specific payloads). Rendering is limited to generic snapshots and declarative details. There are no remote catalogs,
downloaded plugins/assets, custom SVGs, imports, arbitrary local I/O, or compatibility fallback from an unknown ID to a
built-in provider.

## Provider switcher tabs

Enabled user plugins get their own tab by default when **Merge Icons** is enabled; the manifest can omit `topLevel`.
The tab uses the manifest name and icon. Selecting it shows that plugin’s usage followed by any enabled plugins with
explicit `topLevel: false`, which keeps the appended-card placement under provider tabs and Overview. With Merge Icons
disabled, all plugins retain appended-card placement regardless of `topLevel`.

A single plugin works without a redundant switcher, and multiple plugin tabs work even with no built-in providers
enabled. Refresh and Cmd-R refresh the selected plugin; each card’s refresh button targets that card. Completed
refreshes update visible plugin cards, and repeated requests for the same plugin share its in-flight refresh.
Overview continues to summarize built-in providers. This setting changes placement only: it grants no additional host
capabilities and does not change network approval.

## Over-quota snapshots

`snapshotPolicy: {percent: "preserve-overage"}` explicitly preserves finite `usedPercent` values above 100 in all rate
windows, including extra windows. Negative values still become zero, and nonfinite/non-numeric values are rejected.
The default policy (`"clamp"`) remains 0–100. Notion opts in because its allowance endpoint reports meaningful overages;
`ctx.pct` remains clamped, so a preserving plugin computes its own ratio.

## Browser session cache

Bundled providers may declare `cookiePolicy: { selection: "request-url", cache: "nonpersistent" }` alongside
`browser-cookies` and `cookieDomains`. This policy imports declared domains together as one candidate per browser
profile. It never reads or writes the persistent cookie cache. The default `imports: "app-interactive"` requires a
user-initiated app refresh. `imports: "access-gated"` delegates import admission to the existing browser access gate,
including explicit CLI cookie refreshes and already-authorized, strictly no-UI background reads. Notion and ZoomMate
declare this policy to preserve their native source behavior. The caller's interaction and explicit-retry scope follow
the importer across engine callbacks; background calls do not gain interactive authorization. Manual headers remain
usable in the CLI; Off disables both sources.

With this policy, `ctx.browser.sessions(domain)` exposes only the candidate's `id`, source label, and origin.
The header and cookie records remain in Swift, and `ctx.browser.cookieHeader` is denied. Pass the candidate ID as
`cookieSession: session.id` in any GET or POST options. The host selects unexpired cookies for the request URL,
honors host-only/domain scope, Secure, and encoded path boundaries, and retains duplicate names in longest-path-first
order. Manual headers remain bound to their originating host. Unknown, rejected, or previous-fetch IDs fail closed;
scripts cannot combine this option with a Cookie or Host override.

The production transport uses an ephemeral session without ambient cookies, credentials, or response caching.
Same-origin HTTPS redirects reselect cookies for each hop through that same matcher; cross-origin redirects are
rejected. User-installed plugins cannot request these policies.

`cache: "validated-single-entry"` opts into one host-owned cache row for the whole profile, including paired hosts.
Imported candidates are not persisted until the script calls `ctx.browser.acceptCookie(domain, session)` at its
validation boundary: ZoomMate does so after a successful bootstrap, Notion after a successful allowance response.
The call cannot accept unknown, rejected, previous-fetch, or wrong-origin IDs. Cache writes and rejection compare
against the observed entry, so late requests cannot overwrite or erase a replacement session. Interactive cookie
refreshes stage the single replacement and commit it only when the refresh succeeds; failure leaves the old entry intact.
Legacy plain headers and paired `headersByHost` entries are read by the host and upgraded on validation. No cookies
are copied into plugin storage. Candidates expose an opaque `cacheKey`, derived from the canonical credential rather
than the per-fetch ID. For this persistence policy, `ctx.cache` is process-memory-only JSON state shared across runtime
instances within the provider namespace (128 entries, 128-byte keys, 16 KiB values, maximum 24-hour TTL). ZoomMate
uses that key to reuse readable-expiry bearers until 60 seconds before expiry; bearer tokens are never persisted.

`selection: "ranked-source-domains"` also requires an ordered `sourceDomains` list drawn from `cookieDomains`.
The host selects each cookie name from the highest-ranked source within one profile, binds the result to the declared
request host, and then uses the existing URL matcher. `requiredCookies` admits only candidates containing all listed
names. Notion ranks `app.notion.com`, `www.notion.com`, `notion.com`, `www.notion.so`, and `notion.so`, requiring `token_v2`.
Ranked source domains authorize that explicit legacy-to-current-host migration; scripts still receive no cookie values.

An optional `sessionFile: {tokenField: "tokenV2", cookieName: "token_v2"}` declares migration of the provider's existing
`<provider-id>-session.json` file. It cannot name an arbitrary path and requires ranked, single-origin, validated
persistence. The host reads this candidate first in background contexts, writes the compatible file after validation,
and conditionally clears the observed file when rejected. File write-back participates in interactive refresh commit
and rollback and never runs after a failed cookie-cache commit. Files retain owner-only permissions.

`missingCookies: "omit"` allows a declared HTTPS destination to receive a request with no matching cookie; the default
is `"reject"`. ZoomMate needs omission for bearer-only manual captures and failover to a sibling host lacking a leaf
cookie. This never forwards the first host's cookie to its sibling and never permits undeclared destinations.
Qwen Cloud's cross-origin dashboard navigation remains outside this contract.

Bundled plugins that declare multiple cookie domains use separate Keychain-backed cache scopes for each requested
domain under the default header policy. Single-domain plugins retain their existing provider cache. Automatic imports query only the requested domain;
the default browser is Chrome, with existing provider browser-order overrides preserved. Manual headers bypass the
cache and browser import, and Off fails before either is accessed.

Call `ctx.browser.rejectCookie(domain)` after the server rejects a session. The host checks the declared domain and
evicts only the cached entry observed by that fetch (each domain is pinned for the fetch lifetime); a newer session and other domains remain intact. Manual headers
are never erased. User plugins have no persistent cookie cache, so rejection is a validated no-op for them.

## Bundled provider examples

Bundled scripts own requests, error classification, and snapshot mapping; Swift supplies registration, settings, and credential/origin validation. These examples illustrate contracts that differ from the minimal plugin:

| Provider | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| [llmman](llmman.md) | `llmman.ts` reads loaded-model memory from the local `llmman serve` node report. Its API key is optional, so the script sends it without host-owned `auth`. |
| [Chutes](chutes.md) | `chutes.ts` preserves subscription context, allows empty usage, and fetches optional quota details on both engines. Swift supplies credentials and validated API origins. |
| [Abacus AI](abacus.md) | `abacus.ts` runs required credits GET and optional billing POST concurrently, with calendar-month pacing on both engines. Swift supplies Chrome-first validated sessions in lazy batches and a configured refresh budget capped at 90 seconds; at most five candidates are tried. |
| [ai&](aiand.md) | `aiand.ts` follows paired log cursors and sums decimal costs with integer arithmetic before display conversion. Empty windows omit cost; capped/incomplete pagination is estimated. |
| [DevPass](devpass.md) | `devpass.ts` reads billing-cycle and premium weekly credits from LLM Gateway's key-status API; Swift registers the provider and API-key setting. |
| [xKiro](xkiro.md) | `xkiro.ts` reads daily free tokens and UTC reset from the usage API; Swift registers the provider and API-key setting. |
| [Moonshot](moonshot.md) | `moonshot.ts` runs on both engines. Swift resolves the regional credential and `BASE_URL`; the script validates fixed International/China origins and uses `ctx.format.currency` for identity-only balance/deficit text. |
| [DeepInfra](deepinfra.md) | Both engines require both billing GETs, preserve prepaid deductions and monthly cents conversion, and retry transient failures once. |
| [ZenMux](zenmux.md) | Both engines require subscription quotas. Optional USD PAYG enrichment failures preserve quotas except for credential rejection and cancellation. |
| [Atlas Cloud](atlascloud.md), [Vercel AI Gateway](vercel.md) | Fixed-origin bearer GETs return account/team balances as generic details without quota windows. Scripts classify HTTP failures; the host bounds retries. |
| [GitKraken AI](gitkraken.md) | First-party bearer GET with optional organization scope returns generic weekly windows/details. |
| [Charm Hyper](hyper.md) | Declared-domain cookies or a secure API key reach one fixed credits endpoint. TypeScript owns session preference, API fallback, errors, and HC balance parsing. |
| [Zed](zed.md) | Swift discovers editor settings and Keychain credentials. Opt-in browser billing uses only the declared `zed.dev` cookie session, never editor credentials. |
| [Aixy](aixy.md) | TypeScript maps key-scoped usage and budgets; the host validates the configured gateway origin and supplies the API key. |
| [Raycast](raycast.md) | `ctx.browser.sessions` retries candidates for declared `raycast.com` / `www.raycast.com` domains. The broker prefers exact-host cookies over same-name parent cookies and excludes sibling/lookalike hosts. |

## Native adapters with declarative registration

Hugging Face, Nous, Fireworks, xAI, Venice, and Zed also declare `PluginProviderSpec` values. Hugging Face keeps its
serialized, retained script runtime and CLI-token reader. Nous keeps Hermes credential validation and diagnostics;
Fireworks keeps account-slug projection and its typed result-persistence policy. xAI shares the API-key and workspace
fields, with provider-owned team-ID validation. Venice and Zed share their cookie-field declarations while retaining
native source selection and app settings, including Zed's default-Off browser policy.

The spec accepts typed status-page, token-cost, settings-section, and plugin-result-policy options. These contracts are
also needed by the remaining OpenAI API, OpenRouter, Moonshot, and z.ai descriptors; their distinct branding, config
normalization, credit, and pacing contracts still require a separate migration. Native fetch-plan and credential
adapters remain provider-owned, as with ClinePass. A metadata migration must not replace a retained runtime or broaden
credential discovery merely to use the default script builder.
