# Mistral Provider

CodexBar reads Mistral billing usage and subscription allowances with the Mistral web session from
`admin.mistral.ai`. It also fetches credit balance and falls back to the console Vibe endpoint when the subscription
page does not expose a Vibe allowance.

## Setup

1. Open **Settings -> Providers**.
2. Enable **Mistral**.
3. Sign in to [Mistral Admin](https://admin.mistral.ai/organization/usage) in Chrome, Firefox, or Safari.
4. Leave Cookie source on **Automatic**, or switch to **Manual** and paste a `Cookie:` header from a request to
   `admin.mistral.ai`.

Manual cookies must include an `ory_session_*` cookie. A `csrftoken` cookie enables fallback Vibe requests that
require the `X-CSRFTOKEN` header.

On Linux, browser import is unavailable, so the CLI reads Mistral only in Manual mode: set the provider's
`cookieSource` to `manual` and its `cookieHeader` to the pasted header in `~/.config/codexbar/config.json`.

Automatic import tries Chrome, Firefox (including Developer Edition), then Safari. Safari requires Full Disk Access.
Other Chromium browsers remain available through Manual mode. Automatic import reads only unexpired cookies from
the documented Mistral domains.

## Data Sources

CodexBar requests the current UTC month, subscription allowances, and credits from Mistral Admin:

- `GET https://admin.mistral.ai/api/billing/v2/usage?month=<month>&year=<year>`
- `GET https://admin.mistral.ai/subscription` (best-effort included API and Vibe allowances)
- `GET https://admin.mistral.ai/api/billing/credits` (best-effort credit balance)

If the subscription page has no Vibe allowance and a CSRF token is available, CodexBar makes a bounded best-effort
fallback request:

- `GET https://console.mistral.ai/api-ui/trpc/billing.vibeUsage?...`

For the console request, CodexBar forwards only the `csrftoken` and `ory_session_*` cookies. Other
`admin.mistral.ai` cookies stay origin-bound.

## Display

- **Included API** shows the subscription allowance's used percentage, used / total / remaining amount, and reset time.
- The optional **Monthly Plan** window shows the separate Vibe Code allowance with the same details.
- API spend is computed from billed units (`value_paid`, falling back to `value`) and the pricing table. Each unit takes
  the price with the same event type, metric, group, API zone, and service tier; the table lists one metric under
  several of these, and audio-second and priority prices are far higher than standard token prices. Token totals
  and daily buckets use consumed units (`value`, falling back to `value_paid`), so plan-covered usage still counts.
  Legacy tables that omit both API zone and service tier use the unqualified price for the same event type, metric, and group.
- Token totals include API completions, Le Chat, and Vibe Code completions from the billing usage response.
- Daily usage buckets feed the inline usage dashboard.
- The provider card can show credit balance when the credits endpoint returns it.
- Allowance amounts derive from Mistral's reported percentage and allowance size, independently of billed API spend. Zero or malformed allowances are omitted without discarding a valid sibling allowance.
- The Automatic menu bar selection retains API spend; Included API and Monthly Plan select their respective quota percentages.
- Token-cost history is supported through the billing web session; no local log scan is used.
- Unrepresentable billing token totals fail parsing instead of crashing. Display-only model rankings omit an
  overflowing total while retaining valid cost data.
- Final input, cached, and output totals allow signed adjustments in any lane while rejecting totals outside the
  supported integer range.

## Widgets

Usage widgets follow the **Menu bar metric** picker in Mistral's provider settings. The picker appears in every menu bar
style, so Critters and Meter bars users can still pick the widget allowance. Choosing a percentage metric pins
Mistral’s layout against later global layout edits. Without a percentage, the picker changes only the stored metric
and keeps following the global layout:

- **Automatic** and **Included API** show only the API allowance, preserving the existing default.
- **Monthly Plan** shows only the Vibe allowance, falling back to Included API when the plan is missing or unknown.

Automatic still shows API spend in the menu bar. Changing the metric updates widget rows from the existing snapshot,
without another request. After a failed refresh, widgets reselect from the last published usage snapshot and keep its
original measurement time, including across repeated metric changes. This in-memory source is cleared when provider
or account ownership is invalidated. Burn Down eligibility still requires a known window duration and reset.

## CLI Usage

```bash
codexbar usage --provider mistral --verbose
```

Text output includes both Included API and the optional Monthly Plan, each with its percentage, reset date when
available, and used / total / remaining amounts. Amounts are shown as detail, never as a reset time. This uses the
existing snapshot; no additional requests are made. JSON output is unchanged: the Monthly Plan remains in
`extraRateWindows` with the ID `mistral-monthly-plan`.

## Troubleshooting

### "No Mistral session cookies found"

Sign in to [Mistral Admin](https://admin.mistral.ai/organization/usage) in Chrome, Firefox, or Safari, then refresh.

### "Mistral cookie header is invalid"

In manual mode, paste a full `Cookie:` header from an `admin.mistral.ai` request. The header must include an
`ory_session_*` cookie.

### Included allowance, credits, or Vibe plan usage are missing

The billing usage request is required. Subscription allowances, credits, and Vibe usage are best-effort; if an
optional source fails or does not expose data for the account, CodexBar keeps the main Mistral usage result.
